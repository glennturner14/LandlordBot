 In 64 bit environments we force Central to run in 32 bit mode so it is then unable to read
 from the 64 bit part of the registry. In some circumstances though we want to be able to 
 do this such as when a user is trying to use travelling and only has a 64bit version of
 SQL Express 2008 installed. 
 
 In .Net 4 you can do this using .Net calls but for now we need to do this using unmanaged 
 code such as below. If you are reading this and Central now uses .Net 4 then please re-write as approriate!

	<summary>
 the rollback does not bubble up exceptions due to disconnections or
 when there is nothing to rollback. rational is that in these scenarios we
 dont care whether it actually did it or not because the end result is the same
 nothing applied in the transaction is committed.
